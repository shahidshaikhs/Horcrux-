# Horcrux
------
A Horcrux is an object formed by dark magic that is used by a wizard or witch in the Harry Potter series. Horcruxes are created to achieve immortality by splitting a dark wizardâ€™s soul into separate pieces.

Well, I am not a dark wizard nor I know how to make/use a Horcrux. However, I couldn't find a better name for storing all my programming notes in one place. I keep it full of notes for reference and sharing. Most are related to web development but could honestly be about anything - nonfiction, fiction, general life skills and topics, and whatever else I want remember without relying on my unreliable brain.
